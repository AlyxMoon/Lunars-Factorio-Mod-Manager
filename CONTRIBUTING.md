# Welcome!

Hello, and welcome to the app! This is a hobby project and I'm still figuring out how to best code well with others. So if you have any questions / comments / concerns feel free to reach out to me. You are welcome to help out however you wish.

## Getting Started
- Have both `node` and `npm` installed
- Make sure you have Factorio installed (app currently isn't smart enough to work without it)
- Fork the repository and get it on your computer however you wish
- Run `npm install` while in the repository to initialize the project
- Run `npm run start`

## Making Changes
- All work is based on develop, master branch is reserved for code that is ready to have a release made
- Create a new branch with your work on it, based on develop or another sub branch of your choice
- Please make sure your code is linted (I'm using [Standard.js](https://standardjs.com/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.github.io/eslint-plugin-vue/) rules).  
If your code editor is configured for it, linting will be done automatically, otherwise you can run `npm run lint` to check your code or `npm run lint:fix` to let lint try to automatically fix errors
