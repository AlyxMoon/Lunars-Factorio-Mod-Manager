# Lunar's [Factorio] Mod Manager
My take on an external mod manager for Factorio.

This will be a cross-platform application, created in [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), made for the purpose of managing mods in Factorio. The planned feature list is:

* Enable and disable mods
* Manage mod profiles
* View information about mods
* Download mods from the online mod portal
* Browse servers and save files
* Automatically create and activate profiles based on server/saves user wishes to play on
