LFMM is a tool for managing mods in Factorio. The aim is to make it easy to use many different sets of mods at a time.  
Long-term, I would like to add tools that would be of use to power-users and modders.

**Disclaimer**: This is a pet project by a programmer still getting the hang of writing good code. While every attempt will be made to ensure this program is safe and does not have any harmful side-effects, caution should be taken. If you run into any issues, please leave an issue on this repo or post on this mod's page in the [Factorio forums](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=137&t=30394).

## Downloading / Installing
There are currently no compiled versions of the app. Instead, you can download a zip file from the releases page for a proper release version or near the top of this page for the most recent development version.

## Roadmap

**Base Functionality**

- [x] View all installed Factorio mods
- [x] Activate or deactivate mods
- [x] Manage a collection of mods as a single profile
- [x] Start Factorio from the app
- [x] View or download mods from online mod portal
- [x] Manually or automatically update downloaded mods
- [ ] Update or download all mods listed in a profile at once
- [ ] Have compiled packages for Windows, Mac, and Linux

**Server / Save Management**

- [ ] Export a profile for easy sharing
- [ ] View mods in use by saved games and create a profile based on them
- [ ] View server list and create a profile based on mods used in selected server

**Advanced Functionality / Tools for Modders**
- [ ] Allow using a specific Factorio version in profile (for when multiple versions are installed at once)
- [ ] Allow having multiple versions of a mod at once, and in the profile select which version to use
- [ ] Allow editing of a mod and saving that custom version (at minimum, editing config options)
