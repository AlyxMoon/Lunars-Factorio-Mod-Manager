LFMM is a tool for managing mods in Factorio. The aim is to make it easy to use many different sets of mods at a time.

**Disclaimer**: This is an old hobby project that is undergoing a rework. To be safe, you should backup any mods and saves that you might be worried about losing. If you run into any issues you can leave an issue on this repo or post on the [Factorio forums](https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=137&t=30394).
